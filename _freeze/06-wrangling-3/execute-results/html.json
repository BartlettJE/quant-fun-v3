    "markdown": "# Data Wrangling 3: Pivots and Pipes {#06-wrangling-03}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last chapter, we looked at using one-table Wickham verbs to `filter`, `arrange`, `group_by`, `select`, `mutate` and `summarise` the pong data. We also learnt a little more about <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/p#pipe' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A way to order your code in a more readable format using the symbol %&gt;%'>pipes</a> and we saw how to do some quick counting and some ungrouping. Be sure to try out those activities before moving on as we will start to add a few more functions to allow us a few more skills in <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#data-wrangling' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='The process of preparing data for visualisation and statistical analysis.'>data wrangling</a>. \n\nToday, as a progression from working with one table/tibble, we will focus on working with data across two or more tibbles To do this we are going to add two more functions, to the skills we already know. Those are:\n\n* `pivot_longer()` which allows us to **transform** a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/t#tibble' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A container for tabular data with some different properties to a data frame'>tibble</a> from <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/w#wide' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data format where all of the observations about one subject are in the same row'>wide</a> format to <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/l#long' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data format where each observation is on a separate row'>long</a> format.\n\n* `inner_join()` which allows us to **combine** two tibbles together based on common columns. We actually saw this <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/f#function' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A named section of code that can be reused.'>function</a> in Chapter 3 so this might be more of a recap.\n\nAnd just to recap, if you are still struggling with the idea of a function, remember that a function takes an input, performs some action, and gives an output. Think of your toaster again like we mentioned before: it takes bread as an input; it performs the action of heating it up; and it gives an output, the toast. A good thing about a lot of the functions we use is that they are nicely named as verbs to describe what they do - `mutate()` mutates (adds on a column); `arrange()` arranges columns, `summarise()` summarises, etc. But keep in mind that you don't have to know or memorise all the different functions; through practice and repetition you will quickly learn to remember which ones are which and what <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/p#package' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A group of R functions.'>package</a> they come from. Sort of like where to find your spoons in your kitchen - you don't look in the fridge, and then the washing machine, and then the drawer. Nope, you learnt, by repetition, to look in the drawer first time. It's the same with functions. Keep in mind that research methods is like a language in that the more you use it and work with it the more it makes sense. So with that, let's do some practicing! \n\n**Chapter Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n\n- ILO1\n\n## Chapter preparation\n\n### Introduction to the data set \n\nFor this chapter, we are using open data from @alter_vssl_2024. The abstract of their article is:\n\n> The biggest difference in statistical training from previous decades is the increased use of software. However, little research examines how software impacts learning statistics. Assessing the value of software to statistical learning demands appropriate, valid, and reliable measures. The present study expands the arsenal of tools by reporting on the psychometric properties of the Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL) scale in an undergraduate student sample. We propose a brief measure with strong psychometric support to assess students' perceived value of software in an educational setting. We provide data from a course using SPSS, given its wide use and popularity in the social sciences. However, the VSSL is adaptable to any statistical software, and we provide instructions for customizing it to suit alternative packages. Recommendations for administering, scoring, and interpreting the VSSL are provided to aid statistics instructors and education researchers understand how software influences students' statistical learning.\n\nTo summarise, they developed a new scale to measure students' perceived value of software to learning statistics - Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL). The authors wanted to develop this scale in a way that could be adapted to different software, from SPSS in their article (which some of you may have used in the past), to perhaps R in future. Alongside data from their new scale, they collected data from other scales measuring a similar kind of construct (e.g., Students' Attitudes toward Statistics and Technology) and related constructs (e.g., Quantitative Attitudes). \n\nIn this chapter, we will wrangle their data to reinforce skills from Chapter 4 and 5. Scale data is extremely common to work with in psychology and there is a high likelihood you will use one or more in your dissertation or future careers. After recapping skills from the past two chapters on this new data set, we will add more data wrangling functions to your toolkit. \n\n### Organising your files and project for the chapter\n\nBefore we can get started, you need to organise your files and project for the chapter, so your working directory is in order.\n\n1. In your folder for research methods and the book `ResearchMethods1_2/Quant_Fundamentals`, you should have a folder from chapter 4 called `Chapter_04_06_datawrangling`.\n\n2. Create a new R Markdown document and give it a sensible title describing the chapter, such as `06 Data Wrangling 3`. Delete everything below line 10 so you have a blank file to work with and save the file in your `Chapter_04_06_datawrangling` folder. \n\n4. We are working with a new data set separated into two files. The links are data file one ([Alter_2024_demographics.csv](data/Alter_2024_demographics.csv)) and data file two ([Alter_2024_scales.csv](data/Alter_2024_scales.csv)). Right click the links and select \"save link as\", or clicking the links will save the files to your Downloads. Make sure that both files are saved as \".csv\". Save or copy the file to your `data/` folder within `Chapter_04_06_datawrangling`.\n\nYou are now ready to start working on the chapter! \n\n## Recapping all the previous <pkg>dplyr</pkg> functions\n\nIn this first section, we will prepare the data for some analysis later by practicing the data wrangling skills you learnt in Chapters 4 and 5 on this new data set. \n\n### Activity 1 - Load <pkg>tidyverse</pkg> and read the data files\n\nAs the first activity, load <pkg>tidyverse</pkg> and read the two data files. As a prompt, save the data files to these object names to be consistent with the activities below, but you can check your answer below if you are stuck. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package below\n?\n\n# Load the data files\n# This should be the Alter_2024_demographics.csv file \ndemog <- ?\n\n# This should be the Alter_2024_scales.csv file \nscales <- ?\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package below\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data files\n# This should be the Alter_2024_demographics.csv file \ndemog <- read_csv(\"data/Alter_2024_demographics.csv\")\n\n# This should be the Alter_2024_scales.csv file \nscales <- read_csv(\"data/Alter_2024_scales.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 2 - Explore `demog` and `scales`\n\nThe data from @alter_vssl_2024 is split into two data files. In `demog`, we have the participant ID (`StudentIDE`) and several demographic variables. The columns (variables) we have in the data set are:\n\n| Variable       |       Type                       |           Description          |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n| StudentIDE    | double| Participant number             |\n| GenderE    | double| Gender: 1 = Female, 2 = Male, 3 = Non-Binary |\n| RaceEthE    | double| Ethnicity: 1 = Black/African American, 2 = Hispanic/Other Latinx, 3 = White, 4 = Multiracial, 5 = Asian/Pacific Islander, 6 = Native American/Alaska Native, 7 = South/Central American |\n| GradeE    | character| Expected grade: 1 = A,\t2 = B,\t3 = C, 4 = D,\t5 = F |\n| StuStaE    | character| Student status: 1 = Freshman, 2 = Sophomore,\t3 = Junior,\t4 = Senior or Higher |\n| GPAE    | character| Expected Grade Point Average (GPA) |\n| MajorE    | character| Degree major |\n| AgeE    | double| Age in years |\n\nIn `scales`, we then have the participant ID (`StudentIDE`) and all the individual scale items. The columns (variables) we have in the data set are:\n\n| Variable       |       Type                       |           Description          |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n| StudentIDE    | double| Participant number             |\n| MA1E to MA8E    | double| **Enjoyment of Mathematics and statistics**, not analysed in this study. |\n| QANX1E to QANX4E    | double| **Quantitative anxiety**: four items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all Anxious) to 5 (Extremely Anxious) |\n| QINFL1E to QINFL7E    | double| **Quantitative attitudes**: seven items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) |\n| QSF1E to QSF4E    | double| **Study motivation**, not analysed in this study. |\n| QHIND1E to QHIND5E    | double| **Quantitative hindrances**: five items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) |\n| QSC1E to QSC4E    | double| **Mathematical self-efficacy**, not analysed in this study. |\n| QSE1E to QSE6E    | double| **Mathematical ability**, not analysed in this study. |\n| SPSS1E to SPSS10E    | double| **VSSL scale on SPSS**: 10 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never True) to 5 (Always True) |\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\nNow we have introduced the two data sets, explore them using different methods we introduced. For example, opening the data objects as a tab to scroll around, explore with `glimpse()`, or even try plotting some of the variables to see what they look like using visualisation skills from Chapter 3. \n:::\n\n### Activity 3 - Joining the two data sets using `inner_join()`\n\nAt the moment, we have two separate data sets, but it will make things easier to join them together so we have both demographic information and the participants' responses to the scales. \n\nWe did not recap joining data sets in the last chapter, so you might need to revisit Chapter 4 - [Joining two data frames](#04-joins)  - for a recap. \n\nCreate a new data object called `full_data` and see if you can spot a common variable between both data sets that you can use an identifier. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# join demog and scales by a common identifier \nfull_data <- ?\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# join demog and scales by a common identifier \nfull_data <- inner_join(x = demog,\n                        y = scales,\n                        by = \"StudentIDE\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 4 - Selecting a range of columns using `select()`\n\nThere are some scales in the data that @alter_vssl_2024 did not analyse, so we can get rid of them to declutter. Furthermore, the purpose of their study was to validate the new VSSL scale and they found some items did not make the cut. Create a new object called `full_data_select` and **retain** the following variables from your new `full_data` object:\n\n- `StudentIDE`\n\n- `GenderE`\n\n- `RaceEthE`\n\n- `AgeE` \n\n- `QANX1E` to `QINFL7E`\n\n- `QHIND1E` to `QHIND5E`\n\n- `SPSS1E`, `SPSS4E`, `SPSS5E`, `SPSS6E`, `SPSS7E`, `SPSS8E`, `SPSS9E`. \n\nRemember: you can select variables either by **retaining** the variables you want to keep, or **removing** the variables you want to remove. You should have **27** columns remaining. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select the key variables listed above\nfull_data_select <- ?\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk if you chose to retain: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select the key variables listed above\nfull_data_select <- select(full_data,\n                           StudentIDE, \n                           GenderE,\n                           RaceEthE, \n                           AgeE, \n                           QANX1E:QINFL7E, \n                           QHIND1E:QHIND5E, \n                           SPSS1E, SPSS4E, SPSS5E, SPSS6E, SPSS7E, SPSS8E, SPSS9E)\n```\n:::\n\n\nor the following if you chose to remove: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select the key variables listed above\nfull_data_select <- select(full_data,\n                           -GradeE, \n                           -StuStaE, \n                           -GPAE, \n                           -MajorE, \n                           -MA1E:-MA8E,\n                           -QSF1E:-QSF4E,\n                           -QSC1E:-QSE6E,\n                           -SPSS2E, -SPSS3E, -SPSS10E)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 5 - Reorder observations using `arrange()` \n\nFor a quick check of the data, order the values of `AgeE` using the object `full_data_select` and answer the following questions:\n\n1. The youngest participant is <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='2' data-answer='[\"18\"]'/> years old. \n\n2. The old participant is <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='2' data-answer='[\"39\"]'/> years old. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# youngest participants\narrange(?)\n\n# oldest participants\narrange(?)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# youngest participants\narrange(full_data_select, \n        AgeE)\n\n# oldest participants\narrange(full_data_select, \n        desc(AgeE))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 6 - Modifying or creating variables using `mutate()`\n\nConvert gender to labels \n\nConvert ethnicity to labels\n\n#### Bonus activity - reverse coding scales {#06-reverse-coding}\n\nFor a bonus activity, we want to demonstrate a super common task when working with scale data. Often, scales will **<a class='glossary' title='Having two similar questions, one expressed in a positive way, and another expressed in a negative way.'>reverse code</a>** some items to express the same idea in opposite ways: one positive and one negative. If the scale is measuring a consistent construct, the responses should be more positive in one and more negative in the other. If you analysed this immediately, you would get two opposing answers, so a key data analysis step is reverse coding some items so all the numbers mean a similar thing. \n\nIn @alter_vssl_2024, all the VSSL items we removed were reverse coded, but it is a good excuse to practice. Using the `scales` object, what function could you use to recode existing responses? Hint: we want to recode 1 to 5, 2 to 4, etc. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# recode items 2, 3, and 10\nscales_reverse <- mutate(scales,\n                         SPSS2_R = ?,\n                         SPSS3_R = ?,\n                         SPSS10_R = ?)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nBased on what we covered before, we expect you will have completed a perfectly accurate but long process of recoding each item one by one: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# recode items 2, 3, and 10\nscales_reverse <- mutate(scales,\n                         SPSS2_R = case_match(SPSS2E,\n                                              1 ~ 5,\n                                              2 ~ 4,\n                                              3 ~ 3,\n                                              4 ~ 2,\n                                              5 ~ 1),\n                         SPSS3_R = case_match(SPSS3E,\n                                              1 ~ 5,\n                                              2 ~ 4,\n                                              3 ~ 3,\n                                              4 ~ 2,\n                                              5 ~ 1),\n                         SPSS10_R = case_match(SPSS10E,\n                                              1 ~ 5,\n                                              2 ~ 4,\n                                              3 ~ 3,\n                                              4 ~ 2,\n                                              5 ~ 1))\n```\n:::\n\n\nHowever, there is a neat shortcut where you can subject the response from the biggest scale unit plus 1. For example, if you have a 5-point scale, you would subtract the response from 6, if you have a 7-point scale, from 8 etc. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reverse code by subtracting responses from 6\nscales_reverse <- mutate(scales,\n                         SPSS2_R = 6 = SPSS2E,\n                         SPSS3_R = 6 - SPSS3E,\n                         SPSS10_R = 6 - SPSS10E)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 7 - Removing or retaining observations using `filter()`\n\n### Activity 8 - Summarising data using `count()` and `summarise()`\n\nTransition to pivot longer by highlighting issue of not being able to use mean on all the scales. \n\n## Restructuring data using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`\n\n### Tidy data \n\nBut first a little more on data structure and organisation.For most of this book, we will use a type of data organisation known as <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/t#tidy-data' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A format for data that maps the meaning onto the structure.'>tidy data</a>. Any data in this format is easily processed through the `tidyverse` package. However, the data you work with will not always start formatted in the most efficient way possible. If that happens then our first step is to put it into `Tidy Data` format. There are two fundamental principles defining `Tidy Data`:\n\n1. Each variable must have its own column.\n2. Each observation must have its own row.\n\n<a href = \"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">Tidy Data (Wickham, 2014)</a> adds the following principle:\n\n* Each type of observation unit forms a table. \n\nAnd <a href = \"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html\" target = \"_blank\">Grolemund and Wickham (2017)</a> restate this third principle as:\n\n* Each value must have its own cell (i.e. no grouping two variables together, e.g. time/date in one cell).\n\nWhere a cell is where any specific row and column meet; a single data point in a tibble is a cell for example. The <a href = \"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html\" target = \"_blank\">Grolemund and Wickham (2017)</a> book is a very useful read and it is free, but browsing the chapter on Tidy Data will help you visualise how you want to arrange data. Try to keep the principles in mind whilst doing so.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" type='info'}\n<div class=\"info\">\n<p>If you’ve worked with any kind of data before, particularly if you’ve\nused Excel, it’s very likely that you will have used <strong>wide\nformat</strong> or <strong>long format</strong> data. In wide format,\neach participant’s data is all in one row with multiple columns for\ndifferent data points. This means that the data set tends to be very\nwide and you will have as many rows as you have participants.</p>\n<p>Long format is where each <strong>row</strong> is a single\nobservation, typically a single trial in an experiment or a response to\na single item on a questionnaire. When you have multiple trials per\nparticipant, you will have multiple rows for the same participant. To\nidentify participants, you would need a variable with some kind of\nparticipant id, which can be as simple as a distinct integer value for\neach participant. In addition to the participant identifier, you would\nhave any measurements taken during each observation (e.g., response\ntime) and what experimental condition the observation was taken\nunder.</p>\n<p>In wide format data, each <strong>row</strong> corresponds to a\nsingle participant, with multiple observations for that participant\nspread across columns. So for instance, with survey data, you would have\na separate column for each survey question.</p>\n<p><code>Tidy</code> is a mix of both of these approachs and most\nfunctions in the tidyverse assume the tidy format, so typically the\nfirst thing you need to do when you get data, particularly wide-format\ndata, is to reshape it through wrangling. Which is why we teach these\nreally important skills.</p>\n<p>There is more information about <a\nhref=\"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html\">tidy data available\nhere</a>.</p>\n</div>\n:::\n\n\nWe now have all the data we need loaded in, but in order to make it easier for us to get the AQ score for each participant, we need to change the layout of the `responses` tibble to Tidy Data. \n\n### Activity 4: Gathering with pivot_longer()\n\nThe first step is to use the function `pivot_longer()` to transform the data. The pivot functions can be easier to show than tell - you may find it a useful exercise to run the below code and compare the tibble in the newly created object `rlong` with the tibble in the original object, `respones`, before reading on.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrlong <- pivot_longer(data = responses,\n                      cols = Q1:Q10,\n                      names_to = \"Question\", \n                      values_to = \"Response\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo break this code down a little to help you understand it more:\n\n* As with the other tidyverse functions, the first argument specifies the dataset to use as the base, in this case `responses`. \n    * And remember the more experienced and confident you get you do not have to write the argument names, e.g. `data = `.\n* The second argument, `cols` specifies all the columns you want to transform. The easiest way to visualise this is to think about which columns would be the same in the new long-form dataset and which will change. In this case, we only have a single column `Id` that will remain constant and we will transform all the the other columns that contain participant's responses to each question. \n    * The colon notation `first_column:last_column` is used to select all variables from the first column specified to the second column specified. So in our code, `cols` specifies that the columns we want to transform are `Q1` to `Q10`.\n    * Note that \"Gathering\" of columns is based on position in the tibble. If the order of columns in the tibble was Q1 then Q10, the above code would only gather those two columns. As it is, in our tibble, the order, is Q1, Q2, Q3, ... Q10, and therefore the code gathers all the columns between Q1 and Q10.\n* The third and fourth arguments are the names of the new columns we are creating.\n    * `names_to` specifies the names of the new columns that will be created. \n    * Finally, `values_to` names the new column that will contain the measurements, in this case we'll call it `Response`. \n    * These new column names are put in quotes because they do not already exist in the tibble. This is not always the case but is the case for this function.\n    * Note also that these names could have been anything but by using these names the code makes more sense.\n    * Lastly, you do need to write names_to = ... and values_to = ... otherwise the columns won't be created correctly.    \n    \nAnd now that we have run the code and explained it a bit, you may find it helpful to go back and compare `rlong` and `responses` again to see how each argument matches up with the output of the table.\n\n## Combining several functions with pipes \n\n## Test yourself\n\nTo end the chapter, we have some knowledge check questions to test your understanding of the concepts we covered in the chapter. We then have some error mode tasks to see if you can find the solution to some common errors in the concepts we covered in this chapter. \n\n### Knowledge check\n\n* Complete the sentence, the higher the AQ score...<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_AGSKAVNYGX'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGSKAVNYGX\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the less autistic-like traits displayed</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGSKAVNYGX\" value=\"\"></input> <span>has no relation to autistic-like traits</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGSKAVNYGX\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>the more autistic-like traits displayed</span></label></div>\n  \n\n* Assuming that your code all worked, what was the AQ score (just the number) of Participant ID No. 87: <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_GABFIEKKZB'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GABFIEKKZB\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>2</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GABFIEKKZB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>3</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GABFIEKKZB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>5</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GABFIEKKZB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>6</span></label></div>\n  \n\n* Type in the box how many participants had an AQ score of 3 (again just the number): <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='10' data-answer='[\"13\"]'/>  \n\n* The cut-off for the AQ10 is usually said to be around 6 meaning that anyone with a score of more than 6 should be referred for diagnostic assessment. Based on this data, how many participants might be referred for further assessment? <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_PRFKLUEIEI'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRFKLUEIEI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>2</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRFKLUEIEI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>4</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRFKLUEIEI\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>6</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_PRFKLUEIEI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>8</span></label></div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain these answers</button>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n1. As mentioned, the higher the score on the AQ10 the more autistic-like traits a participant is said to show.\n\n2. You could do this by code with `filter(aq_scores, Id == 87)`, which would give you a tibble of 1x2 showing the ID number and score. If you just wanted the score you could use `pull()` but we haven't shown you that yet: `filter(aq_scores, Id == 87) %>% pull(AQ)`. The answer is an AQ score of 2.\n\n3. Same as above but changing the argument of the filter. `filter(aq_scores, AQ == 3) %>% count()`. The answer is 13. Remember you can do this by counting but the code makes it reproducible and accurate every time. You might make mistakes.\n\n4. `filter(aq_scores, AQ > 6) %>% count()` or `filter(aq_scores, AQ >= 7) %>% count()`. The answer is 6.\n        \n:::\n\n\n</div>\n  \n\n**Recap on Wickham Verbs!**\n\nWhich function(s) would you use to approach each of the following problems?\n\n* We have a dataset of 400 adults, but we want to remove anyone with an age of 50 years or more. To do this, we could use the <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>filter()</option><option value=''>summarise()</option><option value=''>group_by()</option><option value=''>mutate()</option><option value=''>arrange()</option><option value=''>select()</option></select> function.\n\n* We are interested in overall summary statistics for our data, such as the overall average and total number of observations. To do this, we could use the <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>filter()</option><option value='answer'>summarise()</option><option value=''>arrange()</option><option value=''>mutate()</option><option value=''>group_by()</option><option value=''>select()</option></select> function.\n\n* Our dataset has a column with the number of cats a person has, and a column with the number of dogs. We want to calculate a new column which contains the total number of pets each participant has. To do this, we could use the <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>summarise()</option><option value=''>arrange()</option><option value=''>select()</option><option value=''>group_by()</option><option value='answer'>mutate()</option><option value=''>filter()</option></select> function.\n\n* We want to calculate the average for each participant in our dataset. To do this we could use the <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>arrange() and mutate()</option><option value=''>group_by() and arrange()</option><option value=''>filter() and select()</option><option value='answer'>group_by() and summarise()</option></select> functions.\n\n* We want to order a dataframe of participants by the number of cats that they own, but want our new dataframe to only contain some of our columns. To do this we could use the <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>group_by() and mutate()</option><option value='answer'>arrange() and select()</option><option value='answer'>filter() and select()</option><option value=''>select() and summarise()</option></select> functions.\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Explain these Answers</button>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n* `filter()` helps us keep and remove rows!\n* `summarise()` is the main function for creating means, medians, modes, etc.\n* `mutate()` can be used to add columns to help add more information.\n* When you want summary statistics for individual groups or participants you have to first `group_by()` and then `summarise()`.\n* You would need to `filter()` first to reduce the people based on their number of cats and then just `select()` the columns you want to keep.\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n### Error mode\n\nThe following questions are designed to introduce you to making and fixing errors. For this topic, we focus on data wrangling using the functions `filter()`, `count()`, and `group_by()` and `summarise()`. Remember to keep a note of what kind of error messages you receive and how you fixed them, so you have a bank of solutions when you tackle errors independently. \n\nCreate and save a new R Markdown file for these activities. Delete the example code, so your file is blank from line 10. Create a new code chunk to load `tidyverse` and the data file: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package below\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data file\npong_data <- read_csv(\"data/witt_2018.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelow, we have several variations of a code chunk error or misspecification. Copy and paste them into your R Markdown file below the code chunk to load `tidyverse` and the data. Once you have copied the activities, click knit and look at the error message you receive. See if you can fix the error and get it working before checking the answer.\n\n## Words from this Chapter\n\nBelow you will find a list of words that were used in this chapter that might be new to you in case it helps to have somewhere to refer back to what they mean.

Be sure to look again at anything you were unsure about and make some notes to help develop your own knowledge and skills. It would be good to write yourself some questions about what you are unsure of and see if you can answer them later or speak to someone about them. Good work today!\n\nBrilliant work again today! You have now recapped one-table verbs and started to expand your knowledge of two-table verbs. These are great to know as for example, as seen above, it actually only took a handful of reproducible steps to get from messy data to tidy data; could you imagine doing this by hand in Excel through cutting and pasting? Not to mention the mistakes you could make! Excellent work! You are a DataWrangling expert! Before finishing, remember to go over anything you are unsure of, and if you have any questions, please post them on Teams. There are some additional questions below to help you check your understanding.\n",
