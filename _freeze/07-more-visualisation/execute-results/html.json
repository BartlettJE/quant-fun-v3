You've already created a number of different plots including bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, qq-plots, and violin-boxplots, but now we will show you how to customise your plots further to give you a better idea of the range and flexibility of visualising data in R. \n\n**Chapter Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \n\n- ILO1.\n\n## Chapter preparation\n\n### Introduction to the data set \n\nFor this chapter, we are using open data from @zhang_present_2014. The abstract of their article is:\n\n> Although documenting everyday activities may seem trivial, four studies reveal that creating records of the present generates unexpected benefits by allowing future rediscoveries. In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and 3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of rediscovery is linked to people’s erroneous faith in their memory of everyday events. By documenting the present, people provide themselves with the opportunity to rediscover mundane moments that may otherwise have been forgotten.\n\nIn summary, they were interested in whether people could predict how interested they would be in rediscovering past experiences. They call it a \"time capsule\" effect, where people store photos or messages to remind themselves of past events in the future. \n\nAt the start of the study (time 1), participants in a romantic relationship wrote about two kinds of experiences. An \"extraordinary\" experience with their partner on Valentine's day and an \"ordinary\" experience one week before. They were then asked how enjoyable, interesting, and meaningful they predict they will find these recollection in three months time (time 2). Three months later, Zhang et al. randomised participants into one of two groups. In the \"extraordinary\" group, they reread the extraordinary recollection. In the \"ordinary\" group, they reread the ordinary recollection. All the participants completed measures on how enjoyable, interesting, and meaningful they found the experience, but this time what they felt, rather than what they predict they will feel. \n\nThey predicted participants in the ordinary group would underestimate their future feelings (i.e., there would be a bigger difference between time 1 and time 2 measures) compared to participants in the extraordinary group. In this chapter, we focus on a composite measure which took the mean of items on interest, meaningfulness, and enjoyment. \n\n### Organising your files and project for the chapter\n\nBefore we can get started, you need to organise your files and project for the chapter, so your working directory is in order.\n\n1. In your folder for research methods and the book `ResearchMethods1_2/Quant_Fundamentals`, create a new folder called `Chapter_07_dataviz`. Within `Chapter_07_dataviz`, create two new folders called `data` and `figures`.\n\n2. Create an R Project for `Chapter_07_dataviz` as an existing directory for your chapter folder. This should now be your working directory.\n\n3. Create a new R Markdown document and give it a sensible title describing the chapter, such as `07 Scatterplots Boxplots Violins`. Delete everything below line 10 so you have a blank file to work with and save the file in your `Chapter_07_dataviz` folder. \n\n4. We are working with a new data set, so please save the following data file: [Zhang_2014.csv](data/Zhang_2014.csv). Right click the link and select \"save link as\", or clicking the link will save the files to your Downloads. Make sure that you save the file as \".csv\". Save or copy the file to your `data/` folder within `Chapter_07_dataviz`.\n\nYou are now ready to start working on the chapter! \n\n### Activity 1 - Read and wrangle the data\n\nAs the first activity, try and test yourself by completing the following task list to practice your data wrangling skills. Create an object called `zhang_data` to be consistent with the tasks below. If you just want to focus on data visualisation, then you can just type the code in the solution. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\n\nTo wrangle the data, complete the following tasks: \n\n1. Load the <pkg>tidyverse</pkg> package. \n\n2. Read the data file `data/Zhang_2014.csv`.\n\n3. Select the following columns: \n\n    - `Gender`\n    \n    - `Age`\n    \n    - `Condition`\n    \n    - `T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite` renamed to `time1_interest`\n    \n    - `T2_Actual_Interest_Composite` renamed to `time2_interest`.\n\n4. There is currently no identifier, so create a new variable called `participant_ID`. Hint: try `participant_ID = row_number()`. \n\n5. Recode two variables to be easier to understand and visualise: \n\n    - Gender: 1 = \"Male\", 2 = \"Female\".\n    \n    - Condition: 1 = \"Ordinary\", 2 = \"Extraordinary\". \n\nYour data should now be in wide format and ready to create a scatterplot. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Show me the solution\nYou should have the following in a code chunk: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package below\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data file\n# This should be the Zhang_2014.csv file \nzhang_data <- read_csv(\"data/Zhang_2014.csv\")\n\n# Wrangle the data for plotting. \n# select and rename key variables\n# mutate to add participant ID and recode\nzhang_data <- zhang_data %>%\n  select(Gender, \n         Age, \n         Condition, \n         time1_interest = T1_Predicted_Interest_Composite, \n         time2_interest = T2_Actual_Interest_Composite) %>%\n  mutate(participant_ID = row_number(),\n         Condition = case_match(Condition, \n                            1 ~ \"Ordinary\", \n                            2 ~ \"Extraordinary\"),\n         Gender = case_match(Gender,\n                             1 ~ \"Male\",\n                             2 ~ \"Female\")) \n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Activity 2 - Explore the data\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Try this\nAfter the wrangling steps, try and explore `zhang_data` to see what variables you are working with. For example, opening the data object as a tab to scroll around, explore with `glimpse()`, or try plotting some of the individual variables to see what they look like using visualisation skills from Chapter 3. \n:::\n\nIn `zhang_data`, we have the following variables:\n\n| Variable       |       Type                       |           Description          |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n| Gender | character| Participant gender: Male (1) or Female (2) |\n| Age  | double| Participant age in years. |\n| Condition | character| Condition participant was randomly allocated into: Ordinary (1) or Extraordinary (2). |\n| time1_interest | double| How interested they predict they will find the recollection on a 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely) scale. This measure is the mean of enjoyment, interest, and meaningfulness. |\n| time2_interest | double| How interested they actually found the recollection on a 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely) scale. This measure is the mean of enjoyment, interest, and meaningfulness. |\n| participant_ID | integer| Our new participant ID as an integer from 1 to 130. |\n\nWe will use this data set to demonstrate different ways of visualising continuous variables, either combining multiple continuous variables in a scatterplot or splitting continuous variables into categories in a boxplot or violin-boxplot. \n\n## Scatterplots {#viz-a3}\n\n### Basic scatterplot\n\nNow let's make a scatterplot plotting `Age` and `interest` to see if there is any relationship between the two. We need to specify both the x and y-axis variables. The following code will produce a very simple scatterplot. Again, you wouldn't use this graph in a paper, but for eye-balling your data it would suffice. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data, aes(x = time1_interest,y = Age))+\n       geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Basic scatterplot](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/scat1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Axis labels\n\nFrom this plot it doesn't look like there is much of a relationship between age and interest ratings. We can now change the labels using the same scale functions as before. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data, aes(x = time1_interest,y = Age))+\n       geom_point()+\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Mean interest score (1-7)\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Age\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with label changes](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/scat2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Adding a regression line\n\nIt's often useful to add a regression line or line of best fit to a scatterplot. The regression line is added with `geom_smooth()` and by default will also provide a 95% confidence interval. You can specify what type of line you want to draw, most often you will need `method = lm`, i.e., a linear model or a straight line. Look up the help documentation for `geom_smooth()` and see what other methods you can use. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data, aes(x = time1_interest,y = Age))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Mean interest score (1-7)\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Age\")+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm) # if you don't want the shaded CI, add se = FALSE to this\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with regression line](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/scat3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grouped scatterplots\n\nWe can use ggplot to show how the relationship might differ for different populations within our data. We do this by adding `colour()` to `aes()` and setting it as whatever variable we would like to distinguish between. In this case, we will see how the relationship between age and interest differs for the male and female participants. There are a few participants with missing gender so we will first filter them out.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nzhang_data %>%\n           ggplot(aes(x = time1_interest, y = Age, colour = Gender))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Mean interest score (1-7)\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Age\")+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Grouped scatterplot](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/scat4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here's that plot with the labels tidied up. Notice the use of `scale_color_discrete()` to adjust the labels for Gender. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" type='warning'}\n<div class=\"warning\">\n<p>When you change the <code>labels</code>, R will simply overwrite the\nnames in the dataset.

We can change this by using `geom_jitter()`, which adds a layer of points that are jittered so that each one is visible.\n\n`height` and `width` affect how much each point is jittered. Play around with the values to see how it affects the data points. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data, aes(x = Condition, y = time1_interest))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot with jittered data](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/bp3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Adding colour\n\nWe may want to add colour to our graph (and for consistency, we'll sort out the labels). We do this by adding the 'fill' argument to the ggplot aesthetic by specifying which variable the colour of the fill should be organised by. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data, aes(x = Condition, y = time1_interest, fill = Condition))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = .1)+\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Condition\") + # note the x-axis is discrete\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Mean interest rating (1-7)\")+\n  scale_fill_discrete(guide = FALSE) # this suppresses the legend because we don't need it\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot with colour](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/bp4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplots for multiple factors\n\nWhen you only have one IV, using the fill command to change the colour is a little redundant, as the colours don't add any additional information. It makes more sense to use colour to represent an additional IV. \n\nFor this example, we'll use `Condition` and `time` as IVs. `fill()` now specifies a second IV, rather than repeating the IV on the x-axis as in the previous plot. \n\nWith multiple IVs the command to overlay the raw data points changes as the data points also need dodged (try running the code with the previous geom_jitter function to see what happens)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nzhang_data_long <- zhang_data %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = time1_interest:time2_interest,\n               names_to = \"Time\",\n               values_to = \"Interest\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data_long, \n       aes(x = Condition, \n           y = Interest, \n           fill = Time))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = .1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot for two factors](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/bp5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Colour-blind friendly options\n\nThere is one more fill option that we can use. Rather than specifying `scale_fill_discrete()`, we can use `scale_fill_viridis_d()`. This function does exactly the same thing but it uses a colour-blind friendly palette (which also prints in black and white). There are 5 different options for colours and you can see them by changing `option` to A, B, C, D or E. Personally I like option E with `alpha = .6` (to control transparency) but that's not an official School position.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(zhang_data_long, aes(x = Condition, y = Interest, fill = Time))+\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = .6)+\n  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = .1)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"E\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplots with friendly colours](07-more-visualisation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 5: Reordering factors {#viz-a5}\n\nR orders categorical variables alphabetically. For gender it didn't really matter whether male or female was represented first and for time 1 and 2 it makes sense for them to be in this order but we may want to change the order of Condition (in my mind it makes more sense for Ordinary to come first, but that may just be me).\n\nTo do this we can use `mutate()` and `fct_level()` to change the factor levels to the order we want.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nzhang_data_long <- zhang_data_long %>%\n  mutate(Condition = fct_relevel(Condition, c(\"Ordinary\", \"Extraordinary\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can re-run the boxplot.

The first draws a `point` to represent the mean, and the second draws an `errorbar` that represents standard error (`mean_se`).  \n* `guides` is a new function and can be used to adjust whether legends are displayed. This has the same effect as specifying `show.legend = FALSE` in both `geom_violin()` and `geom_boxplot()` but it uses less code to do so.  \n* `fatten = NULL` removes the median line from the boxplots.

We are...\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_DHBXAMMCBK'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"\"></input> <span>group_by()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"\"></input> <span>filter()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"\"></input> <span>arrange()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>summarise()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"\"></input> <span>select()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DHBXAMMCBK\" value=\"\"></input> <span>mutate()</span></label></div>\n\n\n**Question 3**. Our data..\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_FSLMTZPEXW'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>mutate()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"\"></input> <span>group_by()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"\"></input> <span>summarise()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"\"></input> <span>select()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"\"></input> <span>arrange()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FSLMTZPEXW\" value=\"\"></input> <span>filter()</span></label></div>\n\n\n**Question 4**. We want...\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_SSMCEUNHQT'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_SSMCEUNHQT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>filter() and select()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_SSMCEUNHQT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>arrange() and mutate()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_SSMCEUNHQT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>group_by() and arrange()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_SSMCEUNHQT\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>group_by() and summarise()</span></label></div>\n \n\n**Question 5**. If we...\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_GEYZEOKTXT'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GEYZEOKTXT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>wide_data %>% pivot_longer() %>% select() %>% summarise() %>% group_by()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GEYZEOKTXT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>select() %>% pivot_longer() %>% group_by() %>% summarise() %>% wide_data</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GEYZEOKTXT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>long_data %>% select() %>% pivot__longer_wider() %>% group_by() %>% summarise()</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_GEYZEOKTXT\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>wide_data %>% select() %>% pivot_longer() %>% group_by() %>% summarise()</span></label></div>\n\n\n### Error mode\n\nThe following questions are designed to introduce you to making and fixing errors. For this topic, we focus on the new types of data visualisation. Remember to keep a note of what kind of error messages you receive and how you fixed them, so you have a bank of solutions when you tackle errors independently. \n\nCreate and save a new R Markdown file for these activities. Delete the example code, so your file is blank from line 10. Create a new code chunk to load <pkg>tidyverse</pkg> and the data files: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package below\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data file\n# This should be the Zhang_2014.csv file \nzhang_data <- read_csv(\"data/Zhang_2014.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelow, we have several variations of a code chunk error or misspecification. Copy and paste them into your R Markdown file below the code chunk to load <pkg>tidyverse</pkg> and the data files. Once you have copied the activities, click knit and look at the error message you receive. See if you can fix the error and get it working before checking the answer.\n\n**Question 6**. Copy the following code chunk into your R Markdown file and press knit. \n\n\n\n````markdown\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n````\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} \n#### Explain the solution\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n**Question 7**. Copy the following code chunk into your R Markdown file and press knit. \n\n\n````markdown\n```{r}\n\n```\n````\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} \n#### Explain the solution\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n**Question 8**. Copy the following code chunk into your R Markdown file and press knit.\n\n\n\n````markdown\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n````\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} \n#### Explain the solution\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Words from this Chapter\n\nBelow you will find a list of words that were used in this chapter that might be new to you in case it helps to have somewhere to refer back to what they mean. The links in this table take you to the entry for the words in the [PsyTeachR Glossary](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/){target=\"_blank\"}. Note that the Glossary is written by numerous members of the team and as such may use slightly different terminology from that shown in the chapter.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n## End of chapter\n\nBlah. \n\n",
